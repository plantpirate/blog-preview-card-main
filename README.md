## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

*There's advantages and disadvantages in each way you decide to position and style an element, by the element itself or via the parent element.


### Continued development

"You don't know what you don't know." 
I need to continue doing various challenges to understand ways to style various elements. Obviously that's the point of these.
